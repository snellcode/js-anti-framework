# js-anti-framework

Requires node and gulp. If you don't have them, here's a good way to get them (Linux)

Node: http://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/

Gulp: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md

When you have node and gulp, install the project using `npm install`. After that, use `gulp build` to build dist files. If you are working on the files, use just `gulp`, and this will watch for file changes and will run build when you save changes.
